In order to run the demo for this project, you need the following software :
- Streamlit
- Tesseract

The dmeo is divided into three parts, one for each task, for the textual task, simply enter a text you wish to analyse and press enter, for the second and third task, either choose an image in the the preloaded example gallery or upload your own. If you upload your own image, tesseract will be used to extract any potential text, in order to get the best possible result, we allow users to edit the extracted text as they wish.
